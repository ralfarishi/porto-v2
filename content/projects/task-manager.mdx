# Task Management Tool

Designed for simplicity and collaboration, this tool helps teams stay organized. It supports real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions.

## Capabilities

- Kanban boards
- Team chat
- File sharing
- Progress tracking

:::warning
Deleting a project will permanently remove all associated tasks and files. This action cannot be undone.
:::

Real-time subscriptions are set up in `onMount`:

```javascript
supabase
	.channel("public:tasks")
	.on("postgres_changes", { event: "*", schema: "public", table: "tasks" }, (payload) => {
		console.log("Change received!", payload);
	})
	.subscribe();
```
