# Intergalactic Travel Agency

Tired of Earth? We get it. The **Intergalactic Travel Agency** specializes in getting you off this rock and onto a new one.

## Destinations

- **Mars**: The classic choice. Red dust, low gravity, and Elon's summer home.
- **Titan**: For those who love methane lakes and chilly weather (-179°C).
- **The Void**: A budget-friendly option. We just shoot you into deep space. No returns.

## Challenges

The "Time Dilation" feature caused a lot of bugs. Users were booking trips in the past. We had to patch the space-time continuum logic twice.
