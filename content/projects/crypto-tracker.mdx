# Crypto Portfolio Tracker

A clean and fast portfolio tracker that aggregates data from multiple sources. It uses the CoinGecko API for real-time price updates.

## Features

- Multi-currency support
- Profit/Loss calculation
- Historical price charts
- Dark mode support

:::info
Data is cached for 60 seconds to avoid hitting API rate limits.
:::

We use `Apollo Client` to fetch data:

```javascript
const GET_COIN_PRICES = gql`
	query GetCoinPrices($ids: [String!]!) {
		coins(ids: $ids) {
			id
			current_price
		}
	}
`;
```
