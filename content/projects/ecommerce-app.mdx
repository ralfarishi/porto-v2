# E-Commerce Mobile App

Built with React Native, this app offers a seamless shopping experience. It features a custom design system, smooth animations, and secure payment processing via Stripe.

## Key Functionalities

- User authentication
- Product catalog with filtering
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Order history

:::warning
This app requires a valid Stripe API key to process payments in production mode.
:::

We use `Redux Toolkit` for state management. Here's a snippet of the cart slice:

```javascript
const cartSlice = createSlice({
	name: "cart",
	initialState: [],
	reducers: {
		addToCart(state, action) {
			state.push(action.payload);
		},
	},
});
```
