# Zombie Survival Kit Shop

Look, we all know it's coming. The **Zombie Survival Kit Shop** is your one-stop destination for ensuring you survive at least the first season of the apocalypse.

## Essential Gear

We curate the finest selection of:

- **Melee Weapons**: Cricket bats, crowbars, and the classic katana.
- **Canned Goods**: Beans that expire in 2050.

## Challenges

Testing the "Panic Button" feature was tricky. We accidentally shipped 500 cans of beans to our lead developer's house. He's set for life now.
