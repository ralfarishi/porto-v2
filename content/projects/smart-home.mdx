# Smart Home Controller

This application connects to various IoT devices using MQTT. Users can control lights, thermostat, and security cameras from a single intuitive interface.

## Highlights

- Device discovery
- Scene automation
- Energy consumption reports
- Voice command integration

:::danger
Ensure your MQTT broker is secured with TLS to prevent unauthorized access to your home devices.
:::

The core connection logic is handled in `src/services/mqtt.js`:

```javascript
import mqtt from "mqtt";

const client = mqtt.connect("wss://broker.hivemq.com:8000/mqtt");

client.on("connect", () => {
	console.log("Connected to MQTT broker");
});
```
