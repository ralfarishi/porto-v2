# Pet Rock Adoption Center

In a fast-paced world, you need a friend who is grounded. Literally. Welcome to the **Pet Rock Adoption Center**, where we match lonely humans with sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic companions.

## Meet the Rocks

- **Rocky Balboa**: A tough piece of granite. Loves training montages.
- **Dwayne**: A charismatic pebble with a great smile.

## Challenges

We tried to implement a "Walk Your Rock" feature using the Geolocation API, but users complained that the rocks weren't moving. We marked it as "working as intended."
