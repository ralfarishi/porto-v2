# The Cheese Stick Koe Empire

Welcome to the digital nerve center of the **Cheese Stick Koe** empire. This isn't just an e-commerce platform; it's a shrine to the holy trinity of dough, cheese, and frying oil.

## The Mission

To ensure that no human being on Earth is more than 30 minutes away from a hot, crispy cheese stick. We're talking about a logistics network that rivals Amazon, but tastier.

- **Payments**: Stripe (because cheese isn't free, sadly).

## Challenges

The biggest challenge? Stopping the dev team from eating the inventory. We lost 40% of Q1 profits to "quality control testing."
