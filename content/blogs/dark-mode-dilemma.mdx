# The Dark Mode Dilemma: Are We Vampires?

I opened a PDF yesterday. It was white. I was blinded for 20 minutes. My retinas are still recovering.

## The Obsession

As developers, we have collectively decided that "Light Mode" is a bug.

- **IDE**: Dark (Dracula theme, obviously).
- **Terminal**: Dark (Transparent background, 80% opacity).
- **Slack**: Dark (Oled black).
- **The Sun**: Too bright. Needs a dimmer switch.

## The Science (Made Up)

I believe that staring at code all day has mutated our eyes. We are now nocturnal creatures. We thrive in the glow of RGB keyboards and 200 nits of brightness.

When a website doesn't have a dark mode toggle, I don't just leave. I inspect element and add `filter: invert(1)`. I am petty like that.

## The "System Default" Betrayal

You know the feeling. You set your OS to Dark Mode. You feel safe. Then you open a legacy settings menu, and BAM!

**#FFFFFF** straight to the face.

It's a flashbang. It's an assault. It's rude.

	**Health Benefit**: Dark mode reduces eye strain by 100% (source: trust me bro).
</Callout>

	**Design Tip**: If your website defaults to light mode, you owe me a pair of sunglasses.
