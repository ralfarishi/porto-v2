# CSS Battles: Flexbox vs Grid (The Cage Match)

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event! Tonight, we settle the debate once and for all. How do you center a `div`? How do you build a layout without crying?

## Round 1: Centering a Div

**Flexbox** comes out swinging!

```css
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

Three lines! Clean, efficient. The crowd goes wild!

But wait! **Grid** enters the ring!

```css
display: grid;
place-items: center;
```

TWO LINES! OH MY GOD! Grid just body-slammed Flexbox with a `place-items` suplex!

## Round 2: The 12-Column Layout

Flexbox is struggling. It's using `calc()`, it's using negative margins. It looks exhausted.

Grid steps up. It looks calm.

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
gap: 1rem;
```

It's a massacre, folks. Flexbox is tapping out! Grid has locked in the `minmax()` submission hold!

## The Verdict

**Disqualified**: `float: left` tried to enter the ring but collapsed due to a missing clearfix.

But let's be real. They're best friends backstage. Flexbox handles the components, Grid handles the page. It's a tag team, not a rivalry.

But don't tell them I said that. I want to see a rematch.
