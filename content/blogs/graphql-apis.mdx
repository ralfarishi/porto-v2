# Building Scalable APIs with GraphQL

GraphQL offers a flexible alternative to REST. This article discusses how to design schemas that scale with your application.

## Schema Design

Designing a good schema is crucial. It serves as the contract between your client and server.

:::warning
Avoid deeply nested queries as they can impact performance.

Example schema definition:

```graphql
type User {
	id: ID!
	name: String!
	posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
	id: ID!
	title: String!
	content: String
}
```
