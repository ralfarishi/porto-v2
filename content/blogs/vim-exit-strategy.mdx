# How to Exit Vim: A Survivor's Guide

Day 1,095. I have forgotten what the mouse cursor looks like. My fingers are permanently curled into the shape of `H`, `J`, `K`, and `L`.

## The Trap

It happens to the best of us. You accidentally type `git commit` without a message. Suddenly, you're in a blank screen with tildes `~` down the side.

You try `Ctrl+C`. Nothing.
You try `Esc`. It just beeps at you.
You try turning off the computer. The terminal persists in your dreams.

## The Escape Codes

I have found ancient scrolls (Stack Overflow) that speak of the "Ex Commands".

1. **The Gentle Exit**: `:q`

   - Use this if you haven't touched anything. It's polite. It's safe.

2. **The "I Made a Mistake" Exit**: `:q!`

   - This is the nuclear option. "I don't care what I typed. Just let me out."

3. **The "I Actually Did Work" Exit**: `:wq`
   - The rarest of them all. You actually edited a file in Vim and want to keep it.

<Callout type="warning">
	**Hardware Damage**: Repeatedly mashing the `Esc` key may void your keyboard warranty.
</Callout>

## Stockholm Syndrome

The scary part? I'm starting to like it.

I tried using VS Code yesterday. I tried to navigate down by pressing `j`. I typed `j` into the document. I felt disgusted.

I think I belong here now.

	**Pro Tip**: If you really can't exit, just buy a new laptop. It's faster.
