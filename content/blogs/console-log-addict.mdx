# Confessions of a console.log Addict

My name is [Your Name], and I am a `console.log` addict.

It started innocently enough. Just a quick `console.log(data)` to see what the API returned. It felt good. I felt in control.

## The Spiral

Soon, one log wasn't enough. I needed to know _where_ I was in the code.

```javascript
console.log("here");
// ... 5 lines later
console.log("here 2");
// ... inside the if statement
console.log("AM I HERE???");
```

My terminal became a stream of consciousness. A diary of my descent into madness.

## Rock Bottom

I hit rock bottom last Tuesday. I was debugging a race condition. I looked at my console, and I saw it:

```javascript
console.log("please work", pleaseWork);
console.log("why is this null", why);
console.log("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA");
```

I realized I wasn't debugging code anymore. I was screaming into the void, and the void was printing `undefined`.

## Recovery

I'm trying to use the debugger now. Breakpoints. Step over. Step into. It's hard. It feels... sterile. I miss the chaos of a thousand logs flying by at 60fps.

But I'm taking it one day at a time.

	**Relapse Warning**: `debugger` statements are a gateway drug to actual understanding. Proceed
