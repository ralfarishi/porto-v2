# Next.js 14: Why I Broke Up with useEffect

It started like any other relationship. I needed data, and `useEffect` was there for me. We had our ups and downs—mostly dependency array issues—but we made it work.

Then **Next.js 14** walked into the room.

## The Encounter

I saw **Server Actions** across the documentation. It looked simple, confident. "Execute server-side code directly from your components," it whispered.

I felt a blush creep up my neck. "But... what about `isLoading` states? What about `fetch` inside `useEffect`?"

Server Actions just smiled. "Baby, where we're going, we don't need API routes."

## The Breakup

I sat `useEffect` down.

"Look," I said, "You're great. You really are. But I'm tired of the waterfalls. I'm tired of the flickering. I met someone else."

`useEffect` cried. It threw a hydration error. It tried to cause an infinite loop to make me stay. But my mind was made up.

## The New Life

Now, I'm with Server Actions. It's different.

```tsx filename="actions.ts"
'use server'

export async function createUser(formData: FormData) {
  // Direct database access? In my component?
  // It feels so wrong, yet so right.
  await db.user.create({ data: ... })
}
```

:::success
**Relationship Status**: Married to Server Actions. We're expecting our first child, `revalidatePath`, next spring.

:::info
My therapist says I have "shiny object syndrome." I say I have "performance optimization goals."

## Conclusion

I still see `useEffect` sometimes, mostly for event listeners or third-party libraries. We nod politely. But the spark is gone. I'm a Server Component girl/boy now.
