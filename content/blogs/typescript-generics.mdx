# Mastering TypeScript Generics

Generics are one of TypeScript's most powerful features, allowing for reusable and type-safe code. In this article, we'll explore some advanced patterns.

## Why Generics?

Generics enable you to write flexible components that can work with a variety of data types.

:::warning
Overusing generics can make your code harder to read. Use them judiciously.

Here is a simple generic function:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
	return arg;
}

let output = identity<string>("myString");
```

## Constraining Generics

You can also constrain the types that a generic can accept.
