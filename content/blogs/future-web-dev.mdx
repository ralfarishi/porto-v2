# The Future of Web Development

As we look ahead, several key trends are emerging that will redefine how we build for the web. From AI-driven code generation to the rise of WebAssembly, the landscape is evolving rapidly.

## AI Integration

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword. It's becoming an integral part of the development workflow.
